# map-978

Website for mapping weather reports/data from my uat978_wx_test project (https://github.com/Oojimentis/uat978_wx_test)

This is a learning experience for me to increase my HTML and Javascript skills and is purely for my own amusement.

Constructive comments and advice are most welcome!

Uses Leaflet (© 2010–2019 Vladimir Agafonkin. https://leafletjs.com) 
and Leaflet Realtime (https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-realtime)

## TODO
* Filter by start/end dates.
* Add NEXRAD radar data - Any ideas how to do this?
